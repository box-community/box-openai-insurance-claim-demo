    "# Smart Insurance Claim Processing with Box and OpenAI Agents SDK and Responses API\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this demo, we'll create an intelligent insurance claim processing system that combines Box for content storage with OpenAI's Agents SDK and Response API. Our system will:\n",
    "1. Create a set of initial demo content\n",
    "2. Access and analyze car crash photos stored in Box\n",
    "3. Generate damage cost estimates based on the photos\n",
    "4. Search for nearby repair shops with good ratings\n",
    "5. Compile all this information into a pre-inspection report for the insurance adjuster using Box Doc Gen\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites \n",
    "\n",
    "### Box Setup\n",
    "In order to use this walkthrough, you will need an enterprise advanced Box instance or Sandbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console)\n",
    "2. Create a new application with the following settings:\n",
    "   - Select \"Custom App\"\n",
    "   - Give your app a name like \"Insurance Claim Processor\"\n",
    "   - Select the \"Automation\" purpose\n",
    "   - Select the \"User Authentication (2.0)\" authentication method type\n",
    "   - Click \"Create App\"\n",
    "   - Add http://localhost:4000/oauth2/callback as a Redirect URI\n",
    "      - Remove the default Redirect URI\n",
    "   - Under the Configuration tab, and under Application Scopes, enable the following:\n",
    "     - Read all files and folders stored in Box\n",
    "     - Write all files and folders stored in Box\n",
    "     - Manage signature requests\n",
    "     - Manage Doc Gen\n",
    "   - Click \"Save Changes\" in the top right\n",
    "3. Once created, note down the Client ID and Client Secret\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Box Doc Gen, make sure it is enabled by an admin in the Admin Console. If you are a Box Admin, you will find the necessary information in [Enterprise Settings Content & Sharing Tab](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404822772755-Enterprise-Settings-Content-Sharing-Tab#h_01FYQGK5RW42T07GV985MQ9E9A) documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI Setup\n",
    "In order to use this walkthrough, you will need an Open AI account with an organization and billing attached. You can find out more about that process in their [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Once your account is created, create and note down API key"

    "- Providing accurate cost estimates\n",
    "- Finding relevant service providers\n",
    "- Generating comprehensive reports\n",
